# Fortnite tweeter
Integration with the Twitter api and the Fortnite tracker api to tweet out data such as if you won, came top 5 or top 10 in a recent match and how many kills you got.

It saves the data in a json file and when called (via cron) will compare data, if you have played another match and got either first, top 5 or top 10 it will tweet it out along with your kills.
